      <h1>history</h1>
      
      In 1999, I had a big problem, when updating a package : the new version was not working !
      So I had to "go back", but it was impossible to find the old rpm file (not on local disk, and not on the net).
      I just had it installed, on another host ...

      <br /><br />
      I do not find any tool on the net, so I write a first release for this need, and I use it rarely.

      <br /><br />
      But, in July 2002, I had a request from another Linux admin.
      As the script seems to match a more general need, I decide to put public on the net, as a project 
      under the Gnu Public License.
